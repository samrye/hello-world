Kia ora peoples of GitHub!

It's been awhile that I have been hanging around with tech types, yet I somehow never got into GitHub. 

I should go back a bit. 

I'm an unapologetic generalist. My background spans countries, industries, skill sets, networks and causes. I thrive in the overlaps of disciplines, or the gaps between them. Recently I realised the closest discipline I feel akin to is Design.

Five years ago, I found myself in Wellington, Aotearoa New Zealand, as the Enspiral Network was just getting started. I had spent the previous 4 years working on Environmental Conservation. Enspiral caught my imagination, and life has never been the same since.

I dont expect to use GitHub for code (although I have another startup in mind), but I am interested in Open Source culture. I wrote a little piece about it recently here: https://medium.com/enspiral-tales/how-might-we-open-source-cultural-technology-4e2ce9ad33ad

I'll be back writing soon!
